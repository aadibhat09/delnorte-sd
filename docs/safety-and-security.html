  <h2>Safety and Security Award</h2>

  <p>
    Synthetic biology will need to be used safely and securely if local people are
    to solve local problems all around the world. The Safety and Security Committee
    is challenging teams to apply biological engineering approaches to manage risks
    associated with synthetic biology. Can you take the next step in progress
    towards knowledge, understanding, and tools that will make the use of synthetic
    biology safer and more secure?

  <h3>What Should this Page Contain?</h3>
  <p>Describe all potential safety and security risks associated with your project, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Biological risks (e.g., pathogenicity, toxicity, environmental impact).</li>
    <li>Chemical risks (e.g., handling hazardous materials).</li>
    <li>Physical risks (e.g., equipment safety).</li>
    <li>Security risks (e.g., potential misuse of technology).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Explain how you are addressing these risks and implementing safety measures.</p>

  <p>Detail any safety features incorporated into your project design, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Choice of a non-pathogenic chassis.</li>
    <li>Selection of parts that minimize harm to humans, animals, or plants.</li>
    <li>Substitution of safer materials in experiments.</li>
    <li>Implementation of "kill-switch" mechanisms or other safety controls.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Explain the rationale behind these design choices.</p>

  <p>
    Ensure that your project adheres to all safety requirements outlined in the
    <a href="https://responsibility.igem.org/safety-policies" target="_blank">Safety Policies page</a>.
