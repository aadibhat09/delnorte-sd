      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Our iGEM project, <strong>[Project Name]</strong>, addresses the problem of <em>[core issue]</em>, which affects <em>[stakeholders/community/environment]</em>. This problem is urgent and underexplored, and our solution offers the potential to bring about <strong>meaningful impact</strong> through synthetic biology.
      </p>

      <h2>Why This Project?</h2>
      <p>
        We chose this project after identifying key issues during our research phase. Specifically, we were drawn to <em>[scientific/social/environmental/etc.]</em> challenges that remain unsolved due to <strong>[limitations in current approaches]</strong>. Our project emerged from in-depth discussions with researchers, stakeholders, and our own community.

      <h2>Project Goals & Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Develop a system that <em>[primary goal]</em>.</li>
        <li>Design genetic circuits to achieve <em>[specific function]</em>.</li>
        <li>Test and validate using <em>[tools/methods]</em>.</li>
        <li>Share our data, tools, and findings for community use.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Inspiration & Background</h2>
      <p>
        Our inspiration came from real-world challenges, particularly in <em>[field/topic]</em>. We were inspired by previous teams such as 
        <a href="https://2024.igem.wiki/heidelberg/description" target="_blank">2024 Heidelberg</a> and 
        <a href="https://2024.igem.wiki/marburg/description" target="_blank">2024 Marburg</a>, who addressed similar issues with innovative strategies.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also examined literature and case studies on <strong>[topic]</strong> to ground our work in current science. This included reviewing <em>[papers, interviews, events, etc.]</em>.

      <h2>Scientific & Technical Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Our approach integrates [e.g., CRISPR, biosensors, cell-free systems, chassis optimization, metabolic engineering]. We engineered [organism/system] to perform [function], using the following methods:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cloning and expression of <strong>[gene/protein/part]</strong></li>
        <li>Characterization using <strong>[analytical methods]</strong></li>
        <li>Validation in <strong>[experimental models/settings]</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Below is a diagram illustrating our system:

      <h2>Experimental Plan</h2>
      <p>
        Our project follows a structured workflow:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Design and model synthetic circuits using [tool/software]</li>
        <li>Build and test constructs in [host organism]</li>
        <li>Optimize performance and collect data</li>
        <li>Evaluate real-world applicabil
