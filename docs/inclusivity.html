  <h2>Inclusivity Award</h2>

  <p>
    The Inclusivity Award recognizes exceptional efforts to include people with
    diverse identities in scientific research. Who is allowed to have a voice in
    iGEM, synthetic biology and science more broadly? How have you developed new
    opportunities to eliminate barriers and allow more people to contribute to,
    participate in and/or be represented by these communities? To compete for this
    prize, activities do not have to be directly related to your teamâ€™s project.
    Document your approach, how you improved inclusivity and what was learned.

  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>
    We should all recognize the importance of building an open and welcoming
    scientific community. A more diverse community involved in creating knowledge
    and technology is more likely to produce a more equitable and representative
    system. Every individual, regardless of background or experience, should have an
    equal opportunity to engage with scientific knowledge and technological
    development. Everyone should be able to share their opinions on the societal
    implications of research.
