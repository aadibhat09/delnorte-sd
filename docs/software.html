  <h2>Best Software Tool</h2>

  <p>
    Regardless of what the topic is, iGEM projects often create or adapt
    computational tools to move their overall project forward. Because they are born
    out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational
    methods) can even prove surprisingly useful for others. Without necessarily
    being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's
    success. This award tries to find and honor such "nuggets" of computational
    work. To be eligible, your software has to be documented and made available
    under an OSI-approved open-source license.
