    <h1>Silver Medal Criterion #1: Engineering Success</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        To achieve engineering success, we followed the iGEM Engineering Design Cycle: <strong>Design â†’ Build â†’ Test â†’ Learn</strong>. This page documents our process for developing a key technical component of our project and our first completed iteration of the cycle.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>ðŸ”§ Design</h2>
      <p>
        We began by identifying the challenge of [insert problem]. Our goal was to create a [biological system/device/part] that could [state objective, e.g., detect, degrade, produce something, etc.]. Based on literature review and previous work, we designed a [promoter/construct/gene circuit] using [specific parts or tools, e.g., BBa_K123456, CRISPRa, biosensor architecture, etc.].
      </p>
      <p>
        We used <em>[software or modeling platform, e.g., Benchling, SnapGene, CellDesigner]</em> to simulate the expected behavior of our design and identify key parameters to optimize.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>ðŸ§¬ Build</h2>
      <p>
        After finalizing the design, we synthesized the DNA sequences through [gene synthesis provider] and cloned the constructs into the [vector name] backbone using [cloning method: Gibson Assembly, Golden Gate, etc.]. The constructs were transformed into <em>[host organism]</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can find the full sequence and documentation on the [<a href="https://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_XXXXXX" target="_blank">Registry Part Page</a>].
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>ðŸ§ª Test</h2>
      <p>
        To evaluate the performance of our engineered system, we conducted [type of assay: fluorescence, enzyme activity, OD measurements, etc.]. We collected quantitative data on [what you measured, e.g., expression levels, degradation rate, biosensor output] under various conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our results showed that [briefly summarize what worked and what didn't, supported with graphs or data visualizations below].
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>ðŸ“ˆ Results</h2>
      <img src="/images/results-graph1.png" alt="Performance graph" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
      <p class="caption">Figure 1: Output levels of [construct/part] across different inducer concentrations.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>ðŸ“š Learn</h2>
      <p>
        Based on our testing, we observed that [insert insights]. This informed our decision to revise [promoter strength, gene order, regulatory elements, etc.]. 
        For the next iteration, we plan to [describe next step, e.g., redesign with a stronger RBS, use a different host, optimize conditions].
      </p>
      <p>
        These learnings are crucial for the improvement of our system and show how weâ€™ve completed one full loop of the design cycle.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Modify [part/element] to improve [goal, e.g., sensitivity, efficiency]</li>
        <li>Test system under [new conditions or host]</li>
        <li>Perform long-term validation and stability analysis</li>
      </ul>
