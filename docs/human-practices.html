    <p>
      How does your project affect society and how does society influence the
      direction of your project? How might ethical considerations and stakeholder
      input guide your project purpose, design and the experiments you conduct in the
      lab? How did this feedback enter into the process of your work throughout the
      iGEM Competition? Document a thoughtful and creative approach to exploring these
      questions and how your project evolved in the process, to compete for this
      award.

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      At iGEM, Human Practices is about more than just outreach. It's about actively
      considering the societal implications of your synthetic biology project and
      demonstrating how those considerations have shaped your work. This page
      documents our team's Human Practices activities and their impact on our project.
