    <h1>🏆 Best Entrepreneurship</h1>
    <p>
      The iGEM Best Entrepreneurship prize rewards teams that successfully explore the commercial potential of their synthetic biology project. Our team has built a strong business foundation that addresses a real-world need, validated through stakeholder feedback, feasibility analysis, and a prototype development.

      <h2>🔍 Identifying a Problem</h2>
      <p>
        We identified a pressing need in the field of [your chosen field – e.g., environmental remediation, agriculture, healthcare, etc.]. After extensive research and engagement with stakeholders, we confirmed that current solutions are [expensive/inefficient/inaccessible], which led us to create a novel synthetic biology solution.
      </p>

      <h2>🔬 Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</h2>
      <p>
        We developed an MVP that demonstrates our product’s core functionality. Our prototype [describe function – e.g., detects X, produces Y] and was tested in the lab under conditions simulating real-world use. Initial results showed [key metrics or validation outcomes].
      </p>
      <p>
        We plan to further refine the MVP through [next steps: pilot deployment, user testing, etc.].
