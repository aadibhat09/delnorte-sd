  <h2>Best Model</h2>

  <p>
    Models and computer simulations can help us understand the function and
    operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Simulation and modeling are critical
    engineering skills that can contribute to project design or provide a better
    understanding of the modeled process. These processes are even more useful
    and/or informative when real-world data are included in the model. This award is
    for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design
    or simulate expected behavior before, or in conjunction with, experiments in the
    wetlab.

  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
    Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the
    function and operation of Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering
    discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the
    behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be
    iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab.
